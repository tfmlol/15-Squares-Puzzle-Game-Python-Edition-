Hey guys,
This is the python version of my Java 15 Squares puzzle Game
- Below is the tutorial I used to build my game, currently incomplete due to some syntax errors but will be fixed within a week from today

- I actually built this before my Java version to help me understand the logic behind building this game so I could build it in Java
